# 05.-DOM-Array-Methods-forEach-map-filter-sort-reduce
This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic web application that interacts with the DOM and manipulates arrays. It fetches random user data, displays it, and provides several functions to manipulate the displayed data, such as doubling the money, filtering millionaires, sorting by wealth, and calculating total wealth.

## Overview
The application consists of a simple interface with a series of buttons that allow the user to perform various operations on the list of users. Users are fetched from the Random User API and displayed with a randomly assigned amount of money. The user can then manipulate this data using the provided buttons.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dom-array-methods.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd dom-array-methods

## Usage
1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

2. Use the buttons on the left to interact with the application:  
   - Add User: Fetch a random user and add them to the list with a random amount of money.
   - Double Money: Double the money of all users in the list.
   - Show Only Millionaires: Filter the list to show only users with more than $1,000,000.
   - Sort by Richest: Sort the list of users by their wealth in descending order. 
   - Calculate entire Wealth: Calculate and display the total wealth of all users in the list.

## Features
- Fetches random users from the Random User API.
- Displays users and their wealth dynamically.
- Provides functionality to double the money, filter millionaires, sort users by wealth, and calculate total wealth.

## How It Works

2. Display Users: The user data is displayed in a list format, showing the name and wealth of each user.
3. Double Money: The user can double the money of all users in the list.
4. Sort by Richest: The user can sort the list of users by their wealth in descending order.
5. Show Only Millionaires: The user can filter the list to show only users with more than $1,000,000.
6. Calculate Total Wealth: The user can calculate and display the total wealth of all users in the list.
