# 05.-DOM-Array-Methods-forEach-map-filter-sort-reduce
This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic web application that interacts with the DOM and manipulates arrays. It fetches random user data, displays it, and provides several functions to manipulate the displayed data, such as doubling the money, filtering millionaires, sorting by wealth, and calculating total wealth.
